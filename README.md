# HTML Lists Example

This repository demonstrates the usage of ordered (`<ol>`) and unordered (`<ul>`) lists in HTML.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a web browser to see the examples.

## Examples

* Unordered lists (`<ul>`) are used for lists where the order of items is not important.
* Ordered lists (`<ol>`) are used for lists where the order of items is important.
* Ordered lists can also have different types of markers (e.g., letters, Roman numerals) using the `type` attribute.
